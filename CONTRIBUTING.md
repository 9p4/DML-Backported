I'm accepting contributions of any kinds and any levels. Beginners are absolutely welcome =)

If you would like to contribute with the project, try to follow some rules to keep everything fine:

# Code
- Commits in both Java and Kotlin are fine as long as the code fits the standard code style of the language
- Don't do anything that could break other mods in general (``@Overwrite`` mixins included)
- Don't do Ninja Coding. Name each identifier as its job
- Keep the identations at four spaces (avoid tabs)
- Comment complex code blocks to explain what tf you're doign
- Any kind of documentation is welcome
- Use the Kotlin's features properly

**Make the code readable at all, no mindfuckery**

# Art
- If any texture or model commited is too complex, It's cool to provide the source of the file too
- Be careful with licenses, please do not put me in trouble by using owned resources or cracked softwares
- Try not to draw random penises

# Documentation & Tutorials
- Avoid using regional slangs, maybe other people won't understand
- Translations are absolutely welcome, but if the language used is not English please add some kind of translation tag sinalizing the language used. Ex: ``[la] Interimo adapare dori me``

# Git
- Try to fix one problem per commit
- Be clear in your commit messages and PR descriptions
