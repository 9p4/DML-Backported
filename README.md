# Deep Mob Learning - FabricMC Version

This is a version of the Deep Mob Learning mod (originally authored by [xt9](https://github.com/xt9/DeepMobLearning)) made to Fabric Mod Loader.

The main theme of this mod (by "this" I mean the version you can find in this repository) is providing cool ways to acquire mob loot. I also have a lot of other plans to implement here and give the mod other purposes too, but since the current stage of the mod is pre-pre-pre-pre alpha thats all I have to offer for now :/

## Xt9's Version
This project is a fork of the original Deep Mob Learning mod, authored by [xt9](https://github.com/xt9/DeepMobLearning).

His version of the mod is focused in providing a better way to acquire mob loot in servers, because creating big mobtraps and things like that doesn't always works well or can have huge performance impacts. If you don't know his version, you should definetively check it out first, he is a pretty cool guy and does a lot of nice things in the Minecraft community.
