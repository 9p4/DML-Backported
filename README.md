By "source file" of textures, models or other resources its meant the file that when put into a specific software can be processed in order to generate the proper resource, but the file itself is not the resource.

By "extension that caracterizes it as a source file" is meant the file extension ".xcf". E.g "data_model_vindicator.xcf"

By "having a source file attached" of texture, models or other resource's file its meant having a file in the same directory with the same name, but an extension that characterizes it as a source file.

All the textures, models and other resources **without a source file** are All Rights Reserved owned by [IterationFunk](https://github.com/xt9/).
